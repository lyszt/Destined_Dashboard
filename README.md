### Continuation of the Scarlett Gateway, but better!
> One must still have chaos in oneself to be able to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: you have yet to become chaos within yourselves. You must be ready to burn yourself in your own flame; how could you rise anew if you have not first become ashes?


Scarlett Gateway began as a productivity tool designed to simplify daily life and streamline task management. The original version, built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, functioned as a standalone web application with a focus on agendas, automation, and reminders. It offered an integrated system for organizing schedules, automating repetitive tasks, and keeping track of important events through notifications. Designed as a personal productivity hub, it combined tools like a dynamic calendar and note-taking capabilities.

The original Scarlett Gateway was eventually discontinued as its core features were split across two new projects: Providentia, which took over the daily life functionalities like task automation and reminders, and my website, Lyszt.net, a platform focused on professional blogging and showcasing technical work. These changes allowed for a more focused approach to productivity and organization.

## The return of the Scarlett Gateway 
The modern Scarlett Dashboard is the spiritual successor to the original project. It retains the same goal of enhancing productivity but introduces a host of new features and improvements, thanks to its adoption of a React frontend, Vite for fast development, and a backend powered by Node.js and Express.
